        <p id="description">Hello, my name is Byongkyu Kim (I go by Ben), and I am a 
            second year computer engineering student from Southern California! 
            Whether it be playing my violin for the elderly at the nursing home or 
            leading my swim team to pack toys for kids fighting cancer, I've realized how meaningful it is to 
            witness the impact of giving back to others. I believe that people learn 
            and grow the most by helping others, and I am exited to combine my passion for coding and helping others! 
            In my free time, I like to play the guitar, go surfing, and spend time with my dog.
